For Fink, Lasair and Alerce we are pulling data via REST api (for now)

You'll need to install Antares Client
pip install antares-client 
(see setup.py)

Lasair needs a token:
Copy .streamlit/secrets.toml.example to .streamlit/secrets.toml on your system
See how to get Lasair token below - then copy it into secrets
