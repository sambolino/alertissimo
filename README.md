# Alertissimo
*An über broker for transient alert orchestration*

Alertissimo is a flexible, inclusive platform for orchestrating astronomical alert streams across the time-domain sky. Designed to unify outputs from brokers like Lasair, AMPEL, Fink, and others, it allows scientists to build custom workflows for filtering, classification, and decision-making — using natural language, a domain-specific language, or visual block building.

Much like a conductor guiding a complex ensemble, Alertissimo brings structure and harmony to the fast-paced, asynchronous world of transient discovery. It enables users to define, refine, and execute real-time logic across multiple brokers. Brokers and their unique features can be seen as instruments and voices in an orchestra and Alertissimo offers scientists the ability to extract the best from every player, just like Duke Ellington!

Built for extensibility and designed for clarity, Alertissimo helps researchers tune their pipelines, collaborate across tools, and stay in sync with the dynamic rhythm of the universe.
